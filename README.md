# MM4_2401FTDS-Anime-Recommender-App
Welcome to the MM4_2401FTDS-Anime-Recommender-App repository! This project showcases an end-to-end anime recommender system built using both collaborative filtering and content-based approaches. The system is designed to predict how a user will rate an anime title they haven't yet viewed, based on their historical preferences. 

This app is deployed using Streamlit, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface for making recommendations. Users can input their preferences and receive tailored anime suggestions instantly.
